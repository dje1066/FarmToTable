		<p style="text-align:center";>Food is such an important aspect of our health. Our group aims to educate others about how to improve eating habits and to become the best versions of ourselves, by controlling what enters our bodies.</p>
		<!-- put images in a zigzag beside (and halfway into) box/text -->
		<p style="text-align:center";>Eating is something we have to do to survive. So, why don't we spice it up a bit? There are many people who don't take the time to make creative meals, full of flavour and colour. There are also many people who give up easily on cooking, and search for the nearest fast-food chain. Taking care of your body starts with food, because down to our basic chemicals, that's how we get the energy to do even the simplest tasks. Now, being healthy doesn't have to be hard. All this talk about carbohydrates, sugars, and calcium intake can be a bit confusing. Everyone starts somewhere.</p>
		
		<p style="text-align:center";>Cooking can become a hobby, just like any other. Except, this hobby is of the healthiest (if done right). Eating well is the precedent to a productive day, and a happier mood.</p>
		<br />
		<p style="text-align:center";>We hope to guide you through this journey of self-improvement, and that you'll notice a change (regardless how small) within your day-to-day life :)</p>
