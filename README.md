# Farmtotable
Shown here is my portion of a group project in first year of university.

ITEC1005 - Web Development, Carleton University 



The included files are only mine. Group member web pages are saved elsewhere. As a group, we decided on the colour scheme, topic, essential elements, and types of pages.

This project was our first taste of web dev! 


Thank you,
Dina
