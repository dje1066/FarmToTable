		<p style="text-align:center";><strong>Food is such an important aspect of our health. Our group aims to educate others about how to improve eating habits and to become the best versions of ourselves, by controlling what enters our bodies.</p>
		<!-- put images in a zigzag beside (and halfway into) box/text -->
		<p style="text-align:center";>Often, food and nutrition is completely skimmed over. To make it more interesting, why don't we spice it up a bit? There are many people who don't take the time to make creative meals, full of flavour and colour. There are also many people who give up easily on cooking, and search for the nearest fast-food chain. Taking care of your body starts with food, because down to our basic chemicals, that's how we get the energy to do even the simplest tasks. Now, being healthy doesn't have to be hard. All this talk about carbohydrates, sugars, and calcium intake can be a bit confusing. Everyone starts somewhere.</p>
		
		<p style="text-align:center";>Only <i>you</i> can control what enters your body. Let's make cooking a hobby, just like any other. Except, this hobby is of the healthiest (if done right). Eating well is the precedent to a productive day, and a happier mood.</p><br />
		
		<p style="text-align:center";>Dive into this journey of self-improvement, and you'll notice changes (regardless how small) within your day-to-day life :) Food is powerful.</strong></p>
